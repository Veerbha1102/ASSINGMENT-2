# Python Module 3: Control Structures - Assignment 2

This repository contains the solutions for Assignment 2 of Module 3: Control Structures in Python.

## Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd (`task1_even_odd.py`)

This program prompts the user to enter an integer and uses an `if-else` statement to determine and print whether the number is even or odd. It also includes basic error handling for non-integer inputs.

## Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop (`task2_sum_50.py`)

This program uses a `for` loop and the `range()` function to iterate through integers from 1 to 50 (inclusive). It calculates the cumulative sum of these integers and prints the final result. The calculated sum is 1275.
